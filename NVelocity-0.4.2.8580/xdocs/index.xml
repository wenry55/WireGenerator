<strong>Velocity release version 1.4-rc1</strong>
<blockquote>
It would appear that active development has once again started on the Velocity project and a release candidate for version 1.4 has been released.  There are also many patches that are finally being applied that have been waiting for some time.  The next versions are expected to support map syntax as well as support for numerics other than integers within the template.  Should be some exciting new additions.<br/>
Many thanks to the developers that are working on that project.
<br/><br/>
Expect updates here soon to match the Velocity changes.

<strong>Maverick.Net - Opt-NVelocity released</strong>
<blockquote>
This message was sent out to all Maverick.NET users:
<blockquote>
I am pleased to announce the availability of a new package that adds 2 new transform and 1 new view option to Maverick.NET.<br/><br/>
The transforms and view are based on work done by the NVelocity project (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nvelocity), which is a port of Velocity, an Apache Jakarta project (http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity).  This package allows for views to be written using NVelocity templates and transforms based on NVelocity templates or Dvsl.  Modified Friendbook examples are included to demonstrate the new options.<br/><br/>
The release notes contain more information on setting up and using Opt-NVelocity as well as setting up the examples.  More information about what NVelocity is can be found at http://nvelocity.sourceforge.net.<br/><br/>
You can get the latest version of all Maverick.NET packages here: <a href="https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=59260">https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=59260</a>

<strong>Maverick.Net - Opt-NVelocity</strong>
<blockquote>
The original Java version of Velocity is commonly used for view generation in many of the popular MVC 
frameworks available in Java.  Shortly, with the great work done by the Maverick.Net team, it will be possible 
to use NVelocity templates in a .Net MVC framework.  Support for NVelocity VTL templates for both view and 
transformation as well as support for Dvsl transformation is nearing completion.  If you are not familiar with 
Maverick.Net or with MVC frameworks, I highly recommend that you check it out at:  <br/><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mavnet">http://sourceforge.net/projects/mavnet</a>

<strong>Dvsl</strong>
<blockquote>
Initial port of Dvsl and DvslTask are now available in CVS.  I think while I am at it that I am going to port Anakia and Texen before creating another release (there is actually still some cleanup that I need to do for Dvsl as it is).  This should round out the ant/NAnt tasks and should complete all of the current functionality of Velocity (what would be included in the velocity.jar, not including the tools sub projects). (<i>31 August 2002</i>)

 <section name="What is NVelocity?">

 <p>
    NVelocity is a .Net-based template engine. It permits anyone to use
    the simple yet powerful template language to reference objects
    defined in .Net code.
</p>
<p>
		    The purpose of this project is to port the Jakarta Velocity project to 
		    Microsoft .Net (written in C#). The intent is to stay as close the the original 
		    Java version as the languages will permit. Please refer to the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">
			Velocity</a> homepage for documentation and other resources. Many thanks go 
		    to Geir and the others who have made Velocity a project worth porting.
